My project for System Software subject. Developed during 3rd year of studies.

It reads PCM audio data from deafult Windows device and converts it to frequency domain using FFTW. The data is normalized to 64 binary represented bars with maximum heoght of 8 and sent to an Arduino board to be displayed on 8x8x8 LED Cube.
